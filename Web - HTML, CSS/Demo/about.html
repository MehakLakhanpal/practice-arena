<dl>
 <dd>We are a group of educationists who feel it is important for people like us to contribute towards the quality of education in our country. Cliched as it may sound, but, spreading knowledge and best practices are the only ways to increase awareness
and to progress.</dd>
 <br>
 <br>
 <dd>The idea for this institute was conceived after considerable deliberations to ensure that we deliver what we promise: the promise to create an environment of learning.</dd>
<br>
 <dd>A grueling research and training with British Council and American TESOL has been undertaken by the founding directors to ensure all aspects of English Proficiency Tests are accurately and clearly explained and tutored. We also pride ourselves at our in house training for our teaching faculty.</dd>
